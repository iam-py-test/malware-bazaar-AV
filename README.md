# MalwareBazaar AV (unofficial)
An antivirus/malware removal tool built on the [Malware Bazaar database](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/export/#txt). The hash list is only updated once a day, [as abuse.ch only updates the list on their servers once a hour](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/export/). <br><br>

**NOTE: 
I am not affiliated with abuse.ch, the creator(s) of Malware Bazaar. I did ask for consent and did receive a response. The datebase used is from https://bazaar.abuse.ch/ and is just mirrored here as to avoid overloading their servers. The submissions to that database are by many malware researchers and abuse.ch. I am not trying to steal their work, just create a program which uses it in new ways. The code here is maintained by iam-py-test**
